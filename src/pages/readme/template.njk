    Any of the HTML files can be shared as a standalone file. However, for the best 
    user experience the whole report should be downloaded. This way you can navigate 
    between the sections using the links.

    Extracting the files to OneDrive may not work as the file-paths excede the limited 
    lengths. So to view the report it is recommended to extract it to your Desktop.
